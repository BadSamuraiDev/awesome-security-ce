# Awesome Community Editions of Enterprise Security Products

This list requires tools that offer long-term Community Editions (CE) derived from their enterprise counterparts. The primary objective is to identify software that provides sustained value without the constraints of short-term trials, enabling users to integrate and familiarize themselves with the tool over a more extended period. While open-source nature is preferred, it is not a mandatory criterion for this list. The goal is to curate a list of enterprise-grade tools that recognize and cater to the broader community through free, long-term versions without compromising the core functionality that makes them standout in their respective domains.
